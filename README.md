## DESCRIPTION
The task of Chinese text detection is to localize the regions in a 2D image which contain Chinese characters. The task of Chinese text recognition is, given the localized regions including text, to convert each region into machine-encoded text. It is an important technique for understanding text information in 2D images, and many other applications such as text-to-speech, machine translation, text mining, etc.
